# Review Findings

Independent review log, written by architecture-review runs (newest first). Each entry lists: slices reviewed, findings (severity + plain-English description), and the corrective slice or ADR created for each significant finding. The owner can read this file to see what the independent reviewer thought of recent work without reading code.

### Finding 1 - Medium - API response envelope is duplicated and already drifting

`sfpcl_credit/ops.py` defines a health-only `success_response` whose `meta` contains `request_id` and `timestamp` only. `sfpcl_credit/identity/views.py` defines a separate auth `success_response` whose `meta` also contains `api_version: "v1"`. The source API contract's standard success envelope includes `api_version` in `meta` (`docs/source/api-contracts.md` §6.1), and the working contract says 002A health endpoints return the standard envelope. This means health and auth responses already disagree before the second auth endpoint family lands.

### Finding 2 - Medium - Auth view owns multi-entity workflow and audit logic

`sfpcl_credit/identity/views.py` currently owns token encoding/decoding, claim construction, refresh-session lookup, refresh rotation, logout revocation, response formatting, and audit-log creation. That was acceptable to get the first auth slice through, but it conflicts with the architecture guidance that views translate HTTP and call module interfaces, while multi-entity operations and audit logging live in explicit modules (`docs/source/technical-architecture.md` §13.1 and `docs/source/codebase-design.md` §6-7). If 002D adds `/api/v1/auth/me/` on top of this shape, auth behavior will become harder to test through a stable module interface and easier to duplicate.

### Finding 3 - Low - Test coverage is behavior-oriented, but one contract gap is now visible

The reviewed tests use real Django client calls, assert rotation/replay/logout behavior, audit creation, inactive-user rejection, PyJWT wrong-secret rejection, expired-token rejection, and environment-secret loading. That is stronger than coverage-only testing. The visible gap is contract coverage for a single shared envelope: health tests and auth tests validate their local response shapes separately, which allowed the `api_version` drift above.
