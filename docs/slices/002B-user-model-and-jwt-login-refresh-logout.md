# Slice 002B: User Model and JWT Login Refresh Logout

## Status
Completed

## Parent Epic
Epic 002: Platform Auth and Role Shell

## Goal
Deliver this narrow capability as a small, testable Ralph implementation slice.

## User Value
Moves the platform one verifiable step closer to a working end-to-end lending system without broad module-sized changes.

## Depends On
- 002A

## Source References
- docs/source/implementation-roadmap.md sections 10, 20-22
- docs/source/technical-architecture.md sections 8-12, 17-18
- docs/source/auth-permissions.md
- docs/source/api-contracts.md sections 11-12, 43-44
- docs/source/data-model.md identity/access tables

## Prototype Reference
- sfpcl-lms/src/pages/auth/LoginScreen.tsx
- sfpcl-lms/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx
- sfpcl-lms/src/components/layout/*
- sfpcl-lms/src/contexts/RoleContext.tsx

## Screens Involved
None directly.

## Frontend Scope
None for this slice, except updating frontend documentation or fixtures if required by tests.

## Backend/API Scope
Implement the named backend/API capability only.

## Database/Model Impact
Non-destructive model/migration changes for this capability, if needed.

## API Contracts
Create or update the API contract for this capability.

## Permissions
Apply the role and object-access rules from `docs/source/auth-permissions.md`; classify unknown access as approval-required.

## Audit Requirements
Record audit/workflow events for critical create/update/approval/access actions.

## Validation Rules
Enforce source-doc business rules and block invalid state transitions.

## Test Cases
Unit/service/API/permission tests plus frontend tests where UI is touched.

## Visual Acceptance Criteria
None.

## Evidence Required
Test output, API response examples, and screenshots when frontend is touched.

## Risk Level
High

## Acceptance Criteria
- The named capability works through the intended backend/API/frontend path, where applicable.
- Source-doc business rules are enforced or documented as assumptions.
- Permissions and audit expectations are tested when applicable.
- The implementation stays within one small Ralph slice.

## Done Checklist
- [x] Execution plan written
- [x] Tests written or updated
- [x] Code implemented
- [x] API contracts updated, if needed
- [x] Database rules followed, if needed
- [x] Permissions tested, if needed
- [x] Audit events tested, if needed
- [x] Visual evidence saved, if frontend
- [x] Tests/typecheck/lint/build passed
- [x] Risk assessment completed
- [x] Handoff updated
- [x] State updated
- [x] Commit created only after passing gates

## Completion Notes

- Implemented backend-only JWT login, refresh rotation, and logout revocation under `/api/v1/auth/`.
- Added user, role, team, session, and audit-log models needed by this slice.
- Full role/permission catalogue seeding, current-user API, admin session controls, and frontend auth wiring remain future slices.
- Visual evidence is not applicable because no frontend screens were changed.
- The delegated commit attempt was blocked by sandbox `.git` restrictions; the outer Ralph operator verified gates and created the final commit afterward.
