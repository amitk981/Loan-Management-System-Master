# Slice 008F: Power of Attorney Workflow

## Status
Not Started

## Parent Epic
Epic 008: Documentation, Legal Documents, and Security Package

## Goal
Deliver this narrow capability as a small, testable Ralph implementation slice.

## User Value
Moves the platform one verifiable step closer to a working end-to-end lending system without broad module-sized changes.

## Depends On
- 008E

## Screens Involved
None directly.

## Frontend Scope
None for this slice, except updating frontend documentation or fixtures if required by tests.

## Backend/API Scope
Implement the named backend/API capability only.

## Database/Model Impact
Non-destructive model/migration changes for this capability, if needed.

## API Contracts
Create or update the API contract for this capability.

## Permissions
Apply the role and object-access rules from `docs/source/auth-permissions.md`; classify unknown access as approval-required.

## Audit Requirements
Record audit/workflow events for critical create/update/approval/access actions.

## Validation Rules
Enforce source-doc business rules and block invalid state transitions.

## Test Cases
Unit/service/API/permission tests plus frontend tests where UI is touched.

## Visual Acceptance Criteria
None.

## Evidence Required
Test output, API response examples, and screenshots when frontend is touched.

## Risk Level
Medium

## Acceptance Criteria
- The named capability works through the intended backend/API/frontend path, where applicable.
- Source-doc business rules are enforced or documented as assumptions.
- Permissions and audit expectations are tested when applicable.
- The implementation stays within one small Ralph slice.
