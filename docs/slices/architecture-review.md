# Internal Run Descriptor: Architecture Review

## Status
Internal — orchestrator-only

## Goal

Provide the stable descriptor expected by Ralph's agent adapter and independent validator when
`ralph-run.sh` executes `architecture_review` mode. This is not a product slice and must never be
selected by the normal slice queue.

## Scope

- Review the slices merged since the previous successful architecture review.
- Follow the architecture-review requirements in `docs/working/AFK_RUNBOOK.md`.
- Do not modify production code.
- Record significant findings in `docs/working/REVIEW_FINDINGS.md` and create or sharpen corrective
  product slices where required.

## Runtime Capabilities

none

## Risk Level
Low
