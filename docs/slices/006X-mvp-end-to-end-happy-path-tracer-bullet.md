# Slice 006X: MVP End-to-End Happy Path Tracer Bullet

## Status
Not Started

## Parent Epic
Epic 006: Eligibility, Loan Limit, Appraisal, and Credit Review
Epic file: `docs/epics/006-eligibility-loan-limit-appraisal.md`

## Goal
Deliver this narrow capability as a small, testable Ralph implementation slice.

## User Value
Moves the platform one verifiable step closer to a working end-to-end lending system without broad module-sized changes.

## Depends On
- 006H

## Source References
- docs/source/implementation-roadmap.md section 11
- docs/source/api-contracts.md sections 22-24
- docs/source/data-model.md eligibility/appraisal tables
- docs/source/functional-spec.md
- docs/source/test-plan.md

## Prototype Reference
- sfpcl-lms/src/pages/appraisal/AppraisalWorkbench.tsx
- sfpcl-lms/src/components/loan/EligibilityChecklist.tsx
- sfpcl-lms/src/components/loan/LoanLimitCalculator.tsx

## Screens Involved
None directly.

## Frontend Scope
None for this slice, except updating frontend documentation or fixtures if required by tests.

## Backend/API Scope
Connect the minimum backend path: member, application, completeness, limit, sanction, documentation readiness, loan account, disbursement, repayment, closure.

## Database/Model Impact
Use only already-created MVP tables; add no broad new schema unless required by the tracer.

## API Contracts
Use existing APIs from prior slices and add only narrow missing glue contracts.

## Permissions
Apply the role and object-access rules from `docs/source/auth-permissions.md`; classify unknown access as approval-required.

## Audit Requirements
Record audit/workflow events for critical create/update/approval/access actions.

## Validation Rules
Only the minimum happy-path gates; do not include every exception, document, report, or compliance edge case.

## Test Cases
One integration/E2E smoke path plus targeted API checks.

## Visual Acceptance Criteria
None.

## Evidence Required
End-to-end log, API responses, and screenshots across the happy path.

## Risk Level
High

## Acceptance Criteria
- The named capability works through the intended backend/API/frontend path, where applicable.
- Source-doc business rules are enforced or documented as assumptions.
- Permissions and audit expectations are tested when applicable.
- The implementation stays within one small Ralph slice.
