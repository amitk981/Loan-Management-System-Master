# Slice 006H: Eligibility Appraisal Frontend Integration

## Status
Not Started

## Parent Epic
Epic 006: Eligibility, Loan Limit, Appraisal, and Credit Review
Epic file: `docs/epics/006-eligibility-loan-limit-appraisal.md`

## Goal
Deliver this narrow capability as a small, testable Ralph implementation slice.

## User Value
Moves the platform one verifiable step closer to a working end-to-end lending system without broad module-sized changes.

## Depends On
- 006G

## Source References
- docs/source/implementation-roadmap.md section 11
- docs/source/api-contracts.md sections 22-24
- docs/source/data-model.md eligibility/appraisal tables
- docs/source/functional-spec.md
- docs/source/test-plan.md

## Prototype Reference
- sfpcl-lms/src/pages/appraisal/AppraisalWorkbench.tsx
- sfpcl-lms/src/components/loan/EligibilityChecklist.tsx
- sfpcl-lms/src/components/loan/LoanLimitCalculator.tsx

## Screens Involved
Relevant prototype screen area for this capability.

## Frontend Scope
Small UI wiring for the named workflow, if applicable.

## Backend/API Scope
Implement the named backend/API capability only.

## Database/Model Impact
None.

## API Contracts
Create or update the API contract for this capability.

## Permissions
Apply the role and object-access rules from `docs/source/auth-permissions.md`; classify unknown access as approval-required.

## Audit Requirements
Record audit/workflow events for critical create/update/approval/access actions.

## Validation Rules
Enforce source-doc business rules and block invalid state transitions.

## Test Cases
Unit/service/API/permission tests plus frontend tests where UI is touched.

## Visual Acceptance Criteria
Match the existing prototype patterns and include loading, empty, error, unauthorized, validation, and success states where relevant.

## Evidence Required
Test output, API response examples, and screenshots when frontend is touched.

## Risk Level
Medium

## Acceptance Criteria
- The named capability works through the intended backend/API/frontend path, where applicable.
- Source-doc business rules are enforced or documented as assumptions.
- Permissions and audit expectations are tested when applicable.
- The implementation stays within one small Ralph slice.
